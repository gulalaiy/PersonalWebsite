         Hey there, welcome to my website! I'm a 15-year-old Pakistani girl who just started high school. I have a deep interest in everything computer science related, especially AI! Although I am quite new to this field, I've been working hard for the past few months to learn more and more about it. I'm excited to see where this path will take me and am always looking forward to opportunities that can help me learn and grow.
