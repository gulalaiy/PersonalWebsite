              <h4>Intro to Data Science: GWC</h4>
              <p>I created a project through the Girls Who Code course that shows how my favorite movie compares to other movies of the same genre. This project provided an excellent introduction to Data Science. I got the opportunity to utilize statistical analysis and data visualization to extract deeper insights from the data.</p>

              <h4>Data Science for Good: GWC</h4>
              <p>I created a project through the Girls Who Code course to analyze and compare the scatter plots of Indonesia and Niger in order to derive meaningful insights and propose a research question through examining the relationship between the percentage of working women in each country and their average years of education.</p>

            <h4>Intro to Machine Learning: GWC</h4>
            <p>I created a project through the Girls Who Code course that uses a Machine Learning technique known as decision trees to classify wether or not someone has heart disease. This project gave me a very good understand of  the core concepts involved in Machine Learning, I specifically got to learn a lot about decision trees and how they work.</p>

          <h4>QBronze using Qiskit: QWorld and Womanium</h4>
          <p>I successfully completed the Bronze-Qiskit online training program on Quantum Computing and Programming, offered by QWorld. This course provided me with a solid foundation in quantum mechanics and computing principles, which I was able to apply using Qiskit.</p>
